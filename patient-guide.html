                <div id="introduction">
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>We have all heard about the extraordinary promise that stem cell research holds for the treatment
                        of a wide range of diseases and conditions. However, there is a lot of work still needed to take
                        this research and turn it into safe and effective treatments.</p>
                    <p>Researchers hope stem cells will one day be effective in the treatment of many medical conditions
                        and diseases. But unproven stem cell treatments can be unsafe - so get all of the facts if
                        you’re considering any treatment.</p>
                    <p><strong>The facts:</strong> Stem cell therapies may offer the potential to treat diseases or
                        conditions for which few treatments exist. Sometimes called the body’s “master cells,” stem
                        cells are the cells that develop into blood, brain, bones, and all of the body’s organs. They
                        have the potential to repair, restore, replace, and regenerate cells, and could possibly be used
                        to treat many medical conditions and diseases. Increasingly, however, hematopoietic stem cells
                        and stem cells derived from sources such as adipose tissue are being used to treat multiple
                        orthopedic, neurologic, and other diseases. (U.S. FDA).</p>
                    <p>We are very concerned that stem cell therapies are being sold around the world before they have
                        been proven safe and effective.</p>
                    <p>Stem cell therapies are nearly all new and experimental. In these early stages, some of them may
                        not work, and there may be downsides. Make sure you understand what to look out for before
                        considering a stem cell therapy.</p>
                    <p>Remember, most medical discoveries are based on years of research performed at universities and
                        companies. There is a long process that shows first in laboratory studies and then in clinical
                        research that something is safe and will work. Like a new drug, stem cell therapies must be
                        assessed and meet certain standards before receiving approval from national regulatory bodies to
                        be used to treat people.</p>
                    <p>What does this really mean for you as a patient, doctor, friend or family member?</p>
                    <p>Below we hope to answer some of your questions on stem cells and stem cell therapies and give you
                        the resources you and your doctor need to make the best decisions possible for treatment.</p>

                    <h2>Patient's Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <p>We receive many questions regarding clinical therapies using stem cells and the availability of
                        stem cell clinical trials. Below, we seek to address some of the important elements that trigger
                        these questions.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="q1">
                    <h3>1. What are stem cells?</h3>
                    <p>Stem cells are the starting point from which the rest of the body grows.</p>
                    <p>The adult human body is made up of hundreds of millions of different types of cells specialized
                        for different tasks. Nerve cells for the brain and nervous system; muscle cells; red blood cells
                        to carry oxygen; white blood cells to fight infection; gut cells to absorb nutrients; cells to
                        make hormones, cells to break down toxins; cells to store fat; cells to make hair; cells to line
                        blood vessels; etc.</p>
                    <p>All of these highly specialized cells have to grow from unspecialized stem cells. Stem cells
                        produce new cells by dividing. In the right conditions, these new cells can then continue to
                        divide and differentiate into specialized cells. Stem cells can also divide to produce new stem
                        cells to replace themselves.</p>
                    <p>Stem cells are defined by two properties. First, they can ‘self-renew,’ that is they can divide
                        and give rise to more stem cells of the same kind. Second, they can mature or ‘differentiate’
                        into specialized cells that carry out a specific function, such as in the skin, muscle, or
                        blood.</p>
                    <p>Stem cells have three properties that set them apart from other cells:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are self-replicating. Most body cells can go through a limited number of divisions and
                            then die. Stem cells can continue to ‘self-renew’, divide and give rise to more stem cells
                            of the same kind indefinitely.</li>
                        <li>They are undifferentiated. This means that they do not have any of the specialized features
                            associated with most of the cells in the body - such as muscle, nerves, fat.</li>
                        <li>They can divide and develop into or ‘differentiate’ into specialized cells of other types
                            that carry out a specific function, such as in the skin, muscle, or blood., to a greater or
                            lesser degree.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are many different types of stem cells. These include embryonic stem cells that exist only
                        at the earliest stages of development; and various types of ‘tissue-specific’ stem cells
                        (sometimes referred to as ‘adult’ or ‘somatic’ stem cells) that are found in various tissues in
                        our bodies. Recently, cells with properties similar to embryonic stem cells referred to as
                        induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells); have been engineered from specialized cells such as
                        skin cells.</p>

                    <h3>2. What is a stem cell therapy?</h3>
                    <p>A stem cell therapy is a treatment that uses stem cells, or cells that come from stem cells, to
                        replace or to repair a patient’s cells or tissues that are damaged. The stem cells might be put
                        into the blood, or transplanted into the damaged tissue directly, or even recruited from the
                        patient’s own tissues for self-repair.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="q3">
                    <h3>3. For what diseases or conditions are stem cell treatments well established?</h3>
                    <p>The range of diseases for which there are proven treatments based on stem cells is still
                        extremely small. Disorders of the blood and immune system and acquired loss of bone marrow
                        function can, in some cases, be treated effectively with blood stem cell transplantation.</p>
                    <p>Doctors have been transferring blood stem cells by bone marrow transplant for more than 50 years,
                        and advanced techniques for collecting blood stem cells are now used clinically. Umbilical cord
                        blood, like bone marrow, is often collected as a source of blood stem cells and is being used
                        experimentally as an alternative to bone marrow in transplantation.</p>
                    <p>Other tissue-specific stem cells may also play a role in tissue transplants that have been
                        performed for several years. For tissues and organs such as skin and cornea, stem cells
                        contained in these tissues contribute to long-term regeneration.</p>
                    <p>Other stem cell treatments are still experimental. This means that it has not yet been shown that
                        this treatment is safe or that it will work.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="q4">
                    <h3>4. What are some of the special considerations for stem cell therapies?</h3>
                    <p>Therapies based on stem cells are largely new and there is a lot that we still need to learn.</p>
                    <p>To start, there are particular challenges in preparing stem cells for use as a medicine. Unlike
                        drugs, stem cells cannot necessarily be produced and tested for quality in large batches, and
                        treatments may even be specific to one patient.</p>
                    <p>For most diseases, it is still being determined which cells will work best to repair a particular
                        damaged or diseased tissue, and how to get those cells to the right place in the body.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, side effects and long-term safety must be determined, since transplanted cells may
                        remain for many years in patients’ bodies. Therefore, careful monitoring and extended follow-up
                        of patients who receive stem cell treatments is extremely important.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="q5">
                    <h3>5. What is the usual process for developing a new medical treatment?</h3>
                    <p>This process is also known as clinical translation.</p>
                    <p>The process starts with very general research into how a tissue or cell usually works and what
                        goes wrong in a particular disease or injury. This information is used to design and develop
                        ways to diagnose, stop or fix what goes wrong.</p>
                    <p>To test whether and how a new intervention might work for a particular disease or injury, studies
                        are done first in vitro (in a dish), and then wherever possible in animals with a disease or
                        injury like ours. These are referred to as preclinical studies; preclinical studies should be
                        reviewed by other experts, published and repeated before moving to research in patients.</p>
                    <p>After demonstrating a reasonable expectation that the treatment will work and be safe, permission
                        is sought to conduct a clinical trial in humans, starting with a very small number of
                        individuals. In some cases, new experimental treatments might be tried on a very small number of
                        people before a clinical trial is started.</p>
                    <p>As the safety and side effects are better understood and methods to get the treatment to the
                        correct part of the body are improved, the number of patients is gradually increased and the new
                        intervention is compared against existing treatments.</p>
                    <p>Once safety and effectiveness is demonstrated through this formal process, a national or regional
                        regulatory agency, for example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European
                        Medicines Agency (EMA), will approve the use of the treatment for particular diseases or
                        conditions.</p>

                    <h3>6. What are the differences between an approved clinical treatment and an experimental
                        intervention?</h3>
                    <p>An approved clinical treatment is a medical practice that has been shown through a formal process
                        of clinical trials to be reasonably safe and effective for treating a particular disease or
                        condition. Normally, such treatments will be approved by a national or regional regulatory
                        agency, for example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines
                        Agency (EMA).</p>
                    <p>An experimental intervention is new, untested, or different from the usual medical treatment. It
                        has not yet been proven that it is safe or that it will work in treating the particular disease.

                <div id="q7">
                    <h3>7. What is a clinical trial?</h3>
                    <p>A clinical trial is a research study designed to answer specific questions about a new treatment
                        or a new way of using current treatments. Clinical trials are used to establish whether new
                        treatments are safe and effective. It is very important to understand that the new treatment
                        being tested is unproven. It may not be better than, or even as good as, existing treatments.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some research studies are not trials. In some cases, new experimental treatments might be tried
                        on a very small number of people before a clinical trial is started. Again, the new treatment
                        being tested is unproven.</p>
                    <p>The fact that a procedure is experimental does not automatically mean that it is part of a
                        research study or clinical trial. Experimental procedures should be made part of a formal
                        research study at an early stage in order to determine whether they are safe and effective.</p>
                    <p>Further information explaining and describing clinical trials written by the National Institutes
                        of Health (USA) can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/info/resources/ .</p>

                    <p>An Informed Consent Form or Treatment Consent Form outlines your role and what might happen to
                        you. It should clearly provide a detailed description of the treatment or procedure in language
                        you understand. It should explain your options for treatment, the risks, your rights and your
                        responsibilities. A consent form is a good way to get the information you need.</p>
                    <p>You should receive a consent form for any experimental stem cell treatment, even if the treatment
                        is not part of a clinical trial. It should emphasize the unproven nature of the treatment and
                        outline the specific risks associated with new stem cell therapies.</p>
                    <p>Once you have read and understood the consent form and have had your questions answered, the form
                        should be signed by you (or your legal representative) and the person providing the information.

                    <h3>9. How do I know if an approved stem cell therapy is safe?</h3>
                    <p>No medical treatment can ever be described as completely safe. There are risks involved with all
                        medical treatment, some small and some great. These risks, even if they are small, should be
                        explained clearly to you by a medical professional.</p>

                    <h3>10. What should I look for if I am considering a stem cell therapy?</h3>
                    <p>You need to be sure that there is good scientific evidence that the treatment is safe and
                        effective, and that your rights as a patient are being respected. To begin, ask for evidence
                        that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preclinical studies (see question 5) have been published, and reviewed and repeated by other
                            experts in the field.</li>
                        <li>The providers have approval from an independent committee such as an Institutional Review
                            Board (IRB) or Ethics Review Board (ERB) to make sure the risks are as low as possible and
                            are worth any potential benefits, and that your rights are being protected.</li>
                        <li>The providers have approval from a national or regional regulatory agency, such as the Food
                            and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the safe conduct of
                            clinical trials or medical use of a product for this disease.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some smaller research studies may not need this level of regulatory approval, but must have
                        approval from an independent review committee (see above) and support from the clinical and
                        administrative leadership where the procedure will be done.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="q11">
                    <h3>11. What should I be cautious about if I am considering a stem cell therapy?</h3>
                    <p>This is not a comprehensive list but some major warning signs include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Claims based on patient testimonials.</strong> Patients want to believe so much that
                            a treatment is helping them that they can convince themselves that it has. They may even
                            have experienced some recovery unrelated to the treatment. Unless there has been carefully
                            evaluated clinical research it is very difficult to know what is a true effect of the
                            treatment and what you can expect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple diseases treated with the same cells.</strong> Unless the diseases are
                            related, such as all being diseases of the blood, different diseases, such as Parkinson’s
                            disease and heart disease, would be expected to have very different treatments. Also, you
                            want to be treated by a doctor that is a specialist in your disease.</li>
                        <li><strong>The source of the cells or how the treatment will be done is not clearly
                                documented.</strong> This should be clearly explained to you in a treatment consent form
                            (see question 8). In addition, there should be a ‘protocol’ that outlines the treatment in
                            detail to the medical practitioner. The protocol is the ‘operating manual’ for the
                            procedure. While it may not be made available to you automatically, you should be able to
                            request this. For a clinical trial or experimental treatment, protocols should have been
                            reviewed for scientific merit by independent experts and approved by an ethics committee to
                            ensure that the rights and well-being of the participants will be respected. Ask who has
                            approved this protocol and when the approval expires.</li>
                        <li><strong>Claims there is no risk.</strong> There is always risk involved with treatment.
                            Information about the possible risks should be available from preclinical or earlier
                            clinical research.</li>
                        <li><strong>High cost of treatment or hidden costs.</strong> It is not customary for someone to
                            pay to be in a clinical trial (other than perhaps travel and other personal expenses).
                            Consider whether you should pay for a treatment that is unproven. Furthermore, ask about the
                            costs of emergency medical care if something goes wrong, particularly if you are outside
                            your own country. Find out what costs your national health program or health insurance
                            provider will cover, in what circumstances and in what countries.</li>

                    <h3>12. What else should I ask?</h3>
                    <p>Ask a lot of questions about the treatment being offered, and seek a second opinion from a doctor
                        you trust. You should not be rushed to make a decision—make sure you understand the entire
                        treatment plan and any risks.</p>
                    <p>The doctors involved should know a lot about your disease, other treatment options and the
                        evidence that the treatment they are offering will be safe and that it will work. You should be
                        provided with an Informed Consent Form or Treatment Consent Form that should address many of
                        your questions (see question 8). This should be signed by both you and the doctor.</p>

                            Review Board? Can you provide me several names of scientists and clinicians who can give me
                            independent advice?</li>

                    <p>You are encouraged to ask a lot of questions about the treatment being offered and to seek second
                        opinions from independent, qualified doctors. Your doctor should be supportive and help in the
                        process of obtaining a second opinion. Medical records, research protocols, treatment protocols
                        (where not well-established), and informed consent documents should be supplied to the person
                        giving a second opinion.</p>

                    <h3>14. How can I find out about clinical trials that use stem cells?</h3>
                    <p>Ask your medical doctor for advice on what is available in your area for your disease or
                        condition. Different clinical trials are offered at different institutions. Remember that
                        clinical trials have very strict entry criteria to safeguard the safety of participants and to
                        make sure that researchers will be able to answer their research question. You may consult the
                        U.S. FDA website - Search for Clinical Trial.</p>
                    <p>There are some databases that allow you to search for registered clinical trials. For example,
                        the public may search a database of clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of
                        Health (USA) at: <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov"
                            target="_blank">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>. Note, however, that not all clinical trials are
                        included in these databases.</p>
