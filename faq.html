                            <p>We use autologous adult adipose-derived stem cells for deployment and clinical research.
                                Early stem cell research has traditionally been associated with the controversial use of
                                “embryonic” stem cells. The new focus is on non-embryonic, non-re-engineered, and not
                                genetically modified autologous adult mesenchymal stem cells, which are found in a
                                person’s own blood, bone marrow, and fat. Cell therapy around the world is shifting its
                                focus from bone marrow-based cells to adipose tissue (fat) derived cells since the cells
                                are easy to obtain and generally very robust.</p>
                            <p>Adipose fat is an abundant and reliable source of stem cells. The best quality adipose
                                cells are derived from the enzymatic digestion of liposuctioned fat, which can be
                                performed at the bedside in an essentially closed system to protect sterility.
                                Autologous stem cells from a person’s own fat are easy to harvest safely under local
                                anesthesia and are abundant and rich in quantities up to 2500 times those seen in bone
                                marrow.</p>
                            <p>Clinical success and favorable outcomes appear to be related directly to the quantity of
                                stem cells deployed. Once these adipose-derived stem cells are administered back into
                                the patient, they have the potential to repair human tissue by influencing healing and
                                also forming new cells of mesenchymal origin, such as cartilage, bone, ligaments,
                                tendons, nerve, fat, muscle, blood vessels, and certain internal organs. Stem cells’
                                ability to form cartilage and bone makes them potentially highly effective in the
                                treatment of degenerative orthopedic conditions. Their ability to form new blood vessels
                                and other tissues makes them suitable for mitigating a large number of traumatic and
                                degenerative conditions.</p>
                            <p>We have anecdotal and clinical-experimental evidence that autologous stem cell therapy is
                                effective in healing and regeneration. Stem cells seek out damaged tissues to repair the
                                body naturally. The solid literature and the Internet are full of successful reports and
                                testimonials, and there are definitive studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of
                                stem cell therapy. Such data took five to ten years to accumulate. In an effort to
                                provide relief for patients suffering from certain degenerative and chronic diseases
                                that have been resistant to common modalities of treatment. Initially, we conducted
                                pilot studies as experimental tests of treatment effectiveness using very high numbers
                                of adipose-derived stem cells obtained from fat.</p>
                            <p>Our techniques for cell harvesting and isolation utilize advanced technologies. This
                                breakthrough enables patients to safely receive their own autologous stem cells in large
                                quantities. Our treatments and research are funded by associates and patients, and we
                                have successfully worked to make them affordable. All our procedures are sterile,
                                non-invasive, and performed under local anesthesia. Patients looking for non-surgical
                                alternatives for degenerative disorders can benefit from our cellular treatments by
                                first completing the “Applicant's Quick Assessment” form to determine their eligibility.

                            <p>Regenerative medicine is a cutting-edge medical field focused on repairing, replacing, or
                                regenerating damaged human cells, tissues, and organs to restore their normal function,
                                often by harnessing the body's own healing abilities or growing new tissues in the lab,
                                using approaches such as stem cells, gene therapy, and biologics. It aims to treat root
                                causes of diseases and injuries, offering potential cures rather than just managing
                                symptoms, with applications in orthopedics, chronic diseases, and organ failure by
                                stimulating previously irreparable damaged organs to heal themselves. Researchers
                                working in the field of regenerative medicine have already made amazing progress in
                                trying to compensate for failing organs. What if we could readily replace diseased?.

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Traditionally, we have used various medications and hormones to limit disease and help
                                the body repair itself. For example, hormone replacement therapy has, in many cases,
                                shown the ability to more optimally help the immune system and thus help us repair
                                diseased or injured tissues. Genetic research is an evolving area where we will
                                eventually learn and utilize more ways of specifically dealing with gene defects causing
                                degenerative disease. Stem cell therapy has already shown considerable promise in
                                treating many degenerative conditions. Stem cells communicate with our tissues and with
                                each other through a complex system of protein signaling molecules called cytokines or
                                “growth factors.” There are thousands of growth factors, and some FDA-approved and
                                clinically available, such as AQ (brand) topical growth factors, a brand using patented
                                technology to deliver human growth factors (GFs) and cytokines topically to stimulate
                                the skin's natural healing and regeneration, which are useful for several cosmetic and
                                therapeutic purposes. The science of using growth factors with stem cells has evolved
                                and represents the next main area of growth in regenerative medicine.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A stem cell is basically any cell that can replicate and differentiate. This means the
                                cell can not only multiply, it can turn into different types of tissues. There are
                                different kinds of stem cells. Most people are familiar with or have heard the term
                                “embryonic stem cell”. These are cells from the embryonic stage that have yet to
                                differentiate – as such, they can change into any body part at all. These are then
                                called “Pluripotent” cells. Because they are taken from unborn or unwanted embryos,
                                there has been considerable controversy surrounding their use. Also, while they have
                                been used in some areas of medicine – particularly, outside the United States – they
                                have also been associated with occasional tumor (Teratoma) formations. There is a work
                                being conducted by several companies to isolate particular lines of embryonic stem cells
                                for future use.</p>
                            <p>Another kind of stem cell is the “adult stem cell.” This is a stem cell that already
                                resides in one’s body within different tissues. In recent times, much work has been done
                                isolating bone-marrow derived stem cells. These are also known as “mesenchymal stem
                                cells” because they come from the mesodermal section of your body. They can
                                differentiate into bone and cartilage, and probably all other mesodermal elements, such
                                as fat, connective tissue, blood vessels, muscle and nerve tissue. Bone marrow stem
                                cells can be extracted and because they are low in numbers, they are usually cultured in
                                order to multiply their numbers for the next use.</p>
                            <p>As it turns out, fat is also loaded with mesenchymal stem cells. In fact, it has hundreds
                                if not thousands of times more stem cells compared to bone marrow. Today, we actually
                                have tools that allow us to separate the stem cells from fat. Because most people have
                                adequate fat supplies and the numbers of stem cells are so great, there is no need to
                                culture the cells over a period of days, and they can be used right away.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>These adult stem cells are known as “progenitor” cells. This means they remain dormant
                                (do nothing) unless they witness some level of tissue injury. It’s the tissue injury
                                that turns them on. So, when a person has a degenerative type problem, the stem cells
                                tend to go to that area of need and stimulate the healing process. Suffice it to say
                                that there are multiple animal models and a plethora of human evidence that indicates
                                these are significant reparative cells.</p>

                            <p>This will depend on the type of degenerative condition you have. A specialist will
                                evaluate you and discuss whether you’re a potential candidate for stem cell therapy. If
                                after you’ve been recommended for treatment, had an opportunity to understand the
                                potential risks and benefits, and decided on your own that you would like to explore
                                this avenue of treatment, then you can be considered for treatment. Of course, even

                            <p>Our surgical procedures are considered a “physician's practice of medicine”, which falls
                                outside the jurisdiction of the FDA, allowing the physician and patient to freely
                                determine their course of treatment. The FDA does have guidelines about treatment and
                                manipulation of a patient’s own tissues. At our global network we meet these guidelines

                                manipulation and are inserted during the same procedure. The US FDA issued an exemption
                                for the use of autologous adult stem cells for the treatment of any specific disease in
                                the United States.</p>

                            <p>Adult (not from embryonic source) Mesenchymal Stem Cells are undifferentiated cells that
                                have the ability to replace dying cells and regenerate damaged tissue. These special
                                cells seek out areas of injury, disease and destruction where they are capable of
                                regenerating healthy cells and enabling a person’s natural healing processes to be
                                accelerated. As we gain a deeper understanding of their medical function and apply this
                                knowledge, we are realizing their enormous therapeutic potential to help the body heal
                                itself. Adult stem cells have been used for a variety of medical treatments to repair
                                and regenerate acute and chronically damaged tissues in humans and animals (racing
                                horses/ camels, farm livestock, and home pets). Although adult stem cells are found in
                                many organs, they are very accessible in high numbers from fat tissue. Other sources of
                                stem cells such as “amniotic” products which are commercially available are not from
                                one’s own body, and these cells are gamma-radiated by the manufacturer and, therefore,
                                are not live cells. If you have been offered amniotic cells from some source, one should
                                be aware of this fact.</p>
                            <p>Many reputable international centers have been using stem cell therapy to treat various
                                chronic degenerative conditions as diverse as severe neurologic diseases, renal failure,
                                erectile dysfunction, degenerative orthopedic problems, and even cardiac and pulmonary
                                diseases, to name a few. Adult stem cells appear to be particularly effective at
                                repairing cartilage in degenerated joints.</p>

                                likely foundation for regenerative treatment.</p>
                            <p>Patients seek improvements through stem cell therapy, which is part of ongoing research
                                to determine optimal treatment parameters, effectiveness, and potential adverse effects.
                                There is substantial evidence showing positive outcomes in cell therapy. Once enough

                            <p>Bone marrow sampling (a somewhat uncomfortable procedure) typically yields around 5,000
                                to 60,000 cells. These cells are cultured over several days to produce a few million
                                cells before they are injected into the patient.</p>
                            <p>Recent advancements in stem cell science have enabled the extraction of large quantities
                                of high-quality multipotent cells from a person’s own liposuction fat. Using advanced
                                technology, doctors can process this fat to obtain approximately 500,000 to 1 million
                                stem cells per cubic centimeter.</p>
                            <p>Consequently, it is possible to harvest as many as 10 million to 40 million cells (or

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Stem cells have played an important role in cancer therapy for five decades.
                                Hematopoietic stem cells (similar to mesenchymal stem cells and also found in stromal
                                vascular fraction) have been used to restore bone marrow and replace blood cell lines
                                after planned ablation of a cancer patient’s bone marrow. This is known as a “stem cell
                                transplant” and is associated with significant risk to cancer patients. Of course, this
                                is different than a regenerative therapy using stem cells to replace or repair damaged
                                tissue.</p>
                            <p>Having said that, new advances in cancer therapy have exploited the stem cell property
                                known as “TROPISM,” or organotropism, which is the ability of stem cells to target
                                tumors. Stem cell tropism—the ability to migrate to tumors—improves treatment by
                                delivering therapeutic agents directly to cancer sites, while clinical trials utilize
                                modified stem cells to secrete agents like TRAIL and interferon-beta (IFN-β).</p>
                            <p>This property has been used to help carry cancer-killing agents deep into the cancer,
                                where the body’s immune system cannot always operate effectively. We are involved in
                                cutting edge clinical trials using stem cells to carry cancer-killing biologic agents
                                deep into cancer tissue that has not responded to conventional therapy.</p>

                                about the various degenerative diseases we treat.</p>
                            <p>Instead of providing simply anecdotal or testimonial information, our goal is to
                                categorize the various conditions and follow the patient’s progress through various
                                objective (e.g., x-ray evidence or video displays) and subjective (e.g., patient and/or

                            <p>Our adipose-derived stem cell harvesting and isolation technique yields extremely high

                                procedure often combines both methods to treat inflammatory and degenerative conditions,
                                with cells usually administered within 90 minutes of processing.</p>
                            <p>Methods of Deployment:<br>Intravenous (IV) Infusion: The concentrated SVF solution is
                                injected into a vein, typically delivering 150 to 200 million cells for systemic,
                                body-wide effects.<br>Local Injection: The SVF is injected directly into a specific,
                                targeted area, such as a joint (intra-articular), near a joint (para-articular), or
                                around specific tissues (e.g., retrobulbar) to promote localized healing.<br>Combined
                                Approach: Often, a portion of the cells is administered intravenously, while the
                                remainder is injected directly into the affected, inflamed area.</p>
                            <p>Biomaterial Harvesting: Adipose tissue is removed via a minimally invasive, local
                                anesthesia liposuction.<br>Processing: The fat is processed (enzymatic digestion,
                                centrifugation) to isolate the SVF.<br>Deployment: The resulting cellular mixture is
                                injected into the patient immediately after preparation.</p>
                            <p>The entire procedure usually takes about 4 hours, and patients are often advised to limit
                                activity for about a week following the injection to allow for cell attachment.</p>

                            <p>No. Participation in any of our protocols is not mandatory, and there are no incentives,

                                dedicated to clinical research for the development of stem cell science. We are taking
                                an active role in cutting-edge clinical research in the new field of regenerative

                                telephonic or video consultations. We strive to negotiate with some insurance providers

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A second opinion involves having the specialist(s) at the “Stem Cell Therapy Center”
                                review your medical history after your consultation with your doctor. It can help you
                                feel more confident in your other optional treatment or gain greater clarity about your
                                diagnosis. Your doctor should be supportive and help you in the process of getting a
                                second opinion. Once the specialist(s) has evaluated your medical history, they may
                                recommend additional tests at the center (or any hospital).</p>
                            <p>A second opinion is not a transfer: Treatment will still be provided by your doctor, even
                                during your second opinion, although you can discuss a transfer to the Center with your
                                physician during your second opinion. If you are invited to a consultation with one of
                                the specialists, the appointment will take place at the Center or through a telephonic
                                or video call. Sometimes you are not invited for a consultation appointment. In that
                                case, the Center shall inform you about the reasons behind that decision. Please note
                                that we always review your medical files thoroughly and confidentially before making
                                this decision.</p>
                            <p>Transfer of treatment: Requesting a transfer of treatment means that you will receive
                                treatment at the "Stem Cell Therapy Center" instead of your current doctor. Once the
                                transfer has been processed, we will discuss and implement your treatment plan. Upon
                                your request for a transfer, we will review your medical history to see whether we are
                                able to take you on as a patient. The Center takes all necessary expertise, the
                                availability, and the necessary time frame of your treatment into consideration during
                                this process. You will keep contact with your current doctor until your request has been
                                approved. You can request a transfer to the center at any time.</p>
                            <p>The Cost: Most health insurance providers will cover one second opinion a year. Please
                                make sure to ask your provider whether your tests, treatments, or second opinion will be
                                covered. If your health insurance does not cover the costs, you will be requested to pay
                                an advance fee. You can pay before your appointment. The actual costs will be settled
                                afterwards. These depend on the care provided, such as additional testing.</p>
                            <p>In case you would like to continue your treatment in the Center. If your costs are not
                                covered by your (national) health insurance, a care administration officer at the Center
                                will notify you of the expected costs beforehand.</p>

                                Vascular Fraction” SVF deployment procedure. Autologous lipo-aspirate can be frozen as
                                SVF (contains mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells). SVF is a mixture of
                                regenerative cells (such as stem cells) and growth factors derived from your own fat
                                tissue, used in regenerative medicine for healing and anti-aging conditions. SVF can be
                                deployed for repeated treatments and also expanded protocols under IRB (Institutional
                                Review Board) and the regulatory bodies' approval as part of a safety trial, providing
                                vast quantities of autologous adult stem cells that could be used throughout that

                                cancer therapy should the need arise. The Cells preservation program is also vital since
                                many of the conditions we treat such as neurodegenerative disorders and auto-immune
                                conditions often require repeat deployments and using banked autologous cells allows
                                this to be done in a convenient and cost effective manner.</p>

                                premises, processes, products, and procedures. For example, in Europe, the European
                                Union, in consultation with relevant authorities in member states and the European
                                Medicines Agency (EMA), develops legislation and subsequently provides guidelines, while
                                the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for this in the United States.
                                Many other countries also adopt cGMP guidelines from the US Food and Drug Administration
